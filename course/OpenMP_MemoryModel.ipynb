    "## **3 - Memory Model and Data-Synchronization**\n",
    "\n",
    "In any multithreaded programming environment, the definition of a memory model becomes crucial. This constitutes an agreement between the programmer and the environment, wherein the system operates under the assumption of rule adherence. When these rules are upheld, the system aligns its behavior with the programmer's expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenMP memory model comprises two fundamental components: a collective global memory accessible to all threads, and a temporary memory for each thread. Every read and write operation pertains to this temporary perspective, which may not necessarily align with the state of the global memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Full consistency is assured solely subsequent to a *flush* operation, which ensures synchronization between the written content in one's private memory view and its visibility in the global memory, as well as making data flushed by others available for reading in one's private view. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMP inherently carries out a flush procedure upon entering or exiting a parallel region, as well as within the critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a \"temporary view\" is merely an abstract depiction of how the system is assured to function. This does not pertain to any specific hardware or software component. In practical terms, the notion of a \"temporary view\" encompasses various elements, including (but not limited to):\n",
    "1. The extent of compiler optimizations applied.\n",
    "2. The operational mechanisms of the CPU's cache memory system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when you modify shared data in your code, the compiler could opt to retain the present value within CPU registers until a flush is required. Alternatively, the CPU might choose to maintain the current value in the L1 cache until flushing becomes necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we run the following code with **two** threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int a = 0;\n",
    "#pragma omp parallel\n",

    "    #pragma omp critical\n",
    "    {\n",

    "If thread 0 enters the critical section first, the timeline of the global memory and the temporary views of the threads are as follows:\n",

    "Each shared data element *X* can be categorized into different classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Only one Thread**: In the parallel region, only one thread accesses *X*, either for reading or writing. This scenario necessitates no synchronization as the value of *X* remains accessible within one thread's temporary view throughout the parallel region and is exclusively flushed at the region's culmination.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Read-Only Variable**: Within the parallel region, *X* remains untouched by write operations. That is, all interactions involve reading. This context eliminates the need for synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Other Scenarios**: It happens when *X* is accessed for reading and writing from different threads. This needs synchronization. Accessing or modifying *X* is confined to a critical section or a synchronization construct.\n",

    "### **3.1 - Critical Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical regions are defined to prevent race conditions and force threads to execute a specific code segment one by one. In OpenMP, the ```#pragma omp critical``` directive is used to define this kind of region. In short, it specifies a code block that is restricted to access by only one thread at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this pragma is used, a thread waits at the beginning of a *critical* section until no other thread in the team is executing a *critical* section having the same name. Therefore, if there are *N* threads, each thread will execute this region. While a thread *I* is executing this region, other threads will have to wait before another thread will start executing the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example contains the situation where different functions are executed in sequential (```a``` and ```z```), and in parallel (```b```, ```c```), and in a critical reigon (```d```). The image below the example depicts the execution of the code with four threads.\n",
